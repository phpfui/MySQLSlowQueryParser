#
# Explanation of above properties vs. (default) parser logic:
# 1. The UnknownProperty property is ignored because Entry::setFromLine()
#    throws away any properties that are not explicitly defined.
# 2. The FirstLine property is ignored because Parser::parse() throws away any
#    line until "# Time: " is encountered.
# 3. The query part in the first entry is ignored because Parser::parse() parses
#    exactly three commented lines; any further comment line will revert to
#    point 1 (and therefore ignore the query plus any other unknown lines).
